# Extractive-Summarization-tool
Extractive methods attempt to summarize articles by selecting a subset of words that retain the most important points.  This approach weights the important part of sentences and uses the same to form the summary. Different algorithm and techniques are used to define weights for the sentences and further rank them based on importance and similarity among each other.
